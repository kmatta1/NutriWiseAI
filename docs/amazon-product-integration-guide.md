## Integration with Existing System

### **Enhanced Cached Stack Service**

The fetcher generates an updated `cached-stack-service.ts` with:

1. **Real Product Data**: Replace placeholder products with verified Amazon products
2. **Improved Filtering**: Smart recommendation logic based on customer archetypes
3. **Fresh Data**: Timestamps for tracking data freshness
4. **Quality Metrics**: Built-in analytics for monitoring system performance

### **Advisor Enhancement**

Your existing advisor system will automatically benefit from:
- **Higher Conversion Rates**: Real products customers can actually purchase
- **Better User Experience**: Working affiliate links and accurate pricing
- **Increased Trust**: Genuine customer reviews and ratings
- **Revenue Growth**: Proper affiliate tracking for commissions

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### **API Usage Tracking**
- Monitor daily request counts (8,640/day limit)
- Track rate limiting (1 request/second)
- Log failed requests for debugging

### **Data Freshness**
- Products should be refreshed monthly
- Monitor for discontinued products
- Update pricing periodically

### **Quality Assurance**
- Validate image URLs are still accessible
- Check affiliate link functionality
- Monitor customer feedback on recommendations

## Compliance and Best Practices

### **Amazon Associates Compliance**
- ‚úÖ Proper affiliate link formatting
- ‚úÖ Required disclaimers displayed
- ‚úÖ No direct image hosting (use Amazon URLs)
- ‚úÖ Regular link validation

### **API Rate Limiting**
- ‚úÖ 1-second delays between requests

- ‚úÖ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Daily usage monitoring

### **Data Security**
- ‚úÖ Environment variable credential storage
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded API keys
- ‚úÖ Secure AWS signature generation
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only requests

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **Invalid Signature Error**
   - Verify AWS credentials are correct
   - Check system time synchronization
   - Ensure proper URL encoding

2. **Rate Limiting (429 Error)**
   - Increase delay between requests
   - Monitor daily usage limits
   - Implement exponential backoff

3. **No Products Found**
